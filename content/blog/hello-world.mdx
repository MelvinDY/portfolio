# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, and honestly, I'm just testing to make sure everything works as expected.

## What Am I Testing?

Building this blog system from scratch means I need to verify:
- Markdown rendering works properly
- The search functionality can find this post
- Tags are displaying correctly
- The responsive design looks good on mobile

## About This Blog

I'll be writing about:
- **Web Development**: Sharing what I learn building projects
- **Tech Experiences**: Honest thoughts on tools and frameworks
- **Project Updates**: Behind-the-scenes of what I'm working on
- **Random Thoughts**: Because sometimes you just need to write

## Testing Some Markdown

Let's make sure the styling works:

### Code Blocks
```javascript
function testBlog() {
  console.log("Hello from my new blog!");
  return "Success! 🎉";
}
```

### Lists
Things I'm excited to write about:
- Next.js 15 features
- Building reusable components
- TypeScript tips and tricks
- Portfolio development journey

### Links
Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/MelvinDY) for the source code of this site!

## What's Coming Next

I'm planning to write about:
1. Building this portfolio from scratch
2. Lessons learned with Next.js App Router
3. Why I chose shadcn/ui over other component libraries
4. The challenges of making responsive navigation

## Quick Personal Note

I'm Melvin, a full-stack developer from Sydney who loves building things with modern web technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring Sydney's coffee scene or planning my next adventure.

This blog is part of my portfolio site, built to share my experiences and hopefully help other developers along the way.

Thanks for stopping by! More substantial content coming soon.
